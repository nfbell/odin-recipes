# odin-recipes
*A simple HTML website displaying recipes (First Project in TOP curriculum)*

This website will demonstrate the following HTML skills:
- Formatting an HTML page properly (e.g. !DOCTYPE, <meta>)
- Implementation of various text containers
- Incorporating Lists (ordered and unordered)
- Linking HTML pages to each other
- Including Images on an HTML page

I'm excited to build my first website, and I'm excited to look back at this in a few monthts
and see how far I've come!
