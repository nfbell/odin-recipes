    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Key Lime pie is like the <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1IgJoRJ34Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Napoleon Dynamite</a></em> 
    of desserts: you either love the distinctive, eccentric flavor that balances on a knife's edge between endearingly sweet and 
    pungently sour, or... you <em>really</em> don't.  Unlike the surreal and perennially quotable cult classic film, 
    unchanged since its release in 2004, Key Lime pie exists on a continuum, and I believe that the recipe
    on the back of a bottle of <strong>Nellie and Joe's Key Lime Juice</strong> can convert the most cynical of sweet tooths.</p>
    <p>This recipe could not be more beginner-friendly: with only three ingredients and basic preperation, the question is not
    <em>can</em> you make it, but rather <em>how often will you?</em></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>9" graham cracker pie crust</li>
        <li>14 oz. can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>3 egg yolks <em>(whites not used)</em></li>
        <li>1/2 cup Nellie and Joe's Key West Lime Juice</li>
        <li>Whipped Cream, for serving</li>
        <li><em>Optional: serve with coffee</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350Â° F. Combine the milk, egg yolks, and lime juice in a bowl.  Blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour filling into graham cracker crust and bake for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Allow to stand 10 minutes before refridgerating.</li>
        <li>Provide whipped cream, which can be added to taste!</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>From personal experience, this pie only gets better with age!  The taste mellows after a day or two, so 
    experiment to see when you like it the best!  If you're trying to convert a skeptic, consider baking the pie
    at least a day in advance to maximize chances of success.  But be warned: by the time your friend comes over,
    you might have to explain why a slice of the pie has mysteriously gone missing...</p>
